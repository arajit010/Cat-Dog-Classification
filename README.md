# Cat-Dog Classification System 🐱🐶

## Introduction 📝
This project is a *Cat-Dog Classification System*. It's a machine learning model designed to identify images of cats and dogs. The system analyses the input image and predicts the output, whether the image is of a cat or a dog.

## Tech Stack 💻
- *Python*: The project is implemented in Python programming language.
- *Numpy and Pandas*: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- *Tensorflow and Keras*: Used for creating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Model 🧠
The core of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs are a class of deep learning models, ideal for analyzing visual imagery. They are widely used in image and video recognition tasks.

## How it works ⚙
1. The system takes an image as input.
2. The image is processed and fed into the CNN model.
3. The model analyses the image and predicts the output.
4. The output is then displayed, indicating whether the image is of a cat or a dog.

## Conclusion 🏁
This Cat-Dog Classification System is a fun and useful project that showcases the power of convolutional neural networks and deep learning.
