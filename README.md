Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog  .
The main goal of this is to develop a system/model that can identify images of cats and dogs. Images of cats and dogs will be used as input and analyzed and then the output is predicted. The model that is implemented can be extended to a website or any mobile device as per the need. The Dogs vs Cats dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website. The dataset contains a set of images of cats and dogs. Our main aim here is for the model to learn various distinctive features of cats and dogs. Once the training of the model is done it will be able to differentiate images of cat and dog.
